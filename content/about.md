Hey, Iâ€™m Rifqi, a polyglot software engineer, software architect, open source enthusiast and expert googler from Indonesia. I learn in public and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.

You can contact me by email at [rifqi.sah@gmail.com](mailto:rifqi.sah@gmail.com) to say hi! I always appreciate meeting new people. (Note: I don't do affiliates or guest posts so those requests will ignored.)

## Open Source Projects
All my open-source projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rifqisah). A few notable favorites are Avansi, an Aisha, and an SIKBK.
